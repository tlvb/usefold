							*Usefold*
Usefold v0.0.1~

Usefold provides functionality to ease putting fold markers based
on indentation when using the marker foldmethod. No maps are
provided by default but has to be set up by the user.

							*Usefold_Folder()*
Usefold_Folder({lnum})
	Creates a fold beginning on {lnum} and ending on the next line
	with the same indent level (|indent()|) as the beginning line.

	If 'filetype' is python, the fold marker is created between
	the last line that is indented more than the beginning line
	and the the line that has the same indentation as the beginning
	line.

	Blank lines, and lines containing only whitespace are not
	checked for indent level and will not be seen as ending a
	block. In the python case, if the end of a code block is followed
	by empty/whitespace, the mark is created as soon as possible,
	at the end of the block.

							*Usefold_FromHere()*
Usefold_FromHere()
	Simple wrapper that calls Usefold_Folder on the current line

							*Usefold_FromInside()*
Usefold_FromInside()
	Checks the indentation on the current line, and searches for the
	first line above it that is indented less, then calls
	|Usefold_Folder()| on it.

							*Usefold_foldtext()*
Usefold_foldtext()
	Alternative |foldtext()| implementation that preserves
	indent, and concatenates the code of the opening and
	closing lines.

Example~
>
	1	int foo(void) {
	2		do_stuff();
	3		for(int i=0; i<128; ++i) {
	4			do_other_stuff();
	5		}
	6	}
<
If the cursor is placed somewhere on line 3 in the code above;
- executing |Usefold_FoldHere()| appends fold markers to line 3 and 5
- executing |Usefold_FromInside()| appends fold markers to line 1 and 6

==============================================================================

Bugs~
- Calling |Usefold_FromInside()| on an empty line behaves as specified,
  but perhaps not as one would expect, or want
